# Before using sources

I've had added git submodules and build them inside `build` in the root directory. Before advancing with source codes or running things make sure that you have a `build` directory and has compiled and are able to use the binaries/shared libraries.

## Current Submodules to Build:
- GEANT4 (my fork)
